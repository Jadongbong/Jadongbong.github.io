        <p>Hi, my name is Jaden He. I'm currently an undergraduate student at the University of Maryland, where I am studying Physics and Piano Peformance, with intention to add a third major in Mathematics. Currently, I am working as an undergraduate researcher with <a href="https://umdphysics.umd.edu/people/faculty/current/item/1990-nschine.html">Nathan Schine</a> in the <a href="https://schine.jqi.umd.edu/">Join Quantum Institute</a>. My interests span multiple areas of math and physics, and I have yet to decide on a specialization. You can find out more about what I'm doing in the <a href="research.html">research</a> section.</p>
        <p> My passion for physics extends beyond the classroom, and I am committed to physics outreach and exposing as many people to physics as possible. I am currently a tutor for UMD's Society of Physics Students and a volunteer with UMD Physics Outreach.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I love playing classical piano, lifting weights, leveling up my coding skills, and dabbling in sports. You can find out more about my hobbies in the <a href="hobbies.html">about me</a> section.</p>
