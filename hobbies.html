                <h2>Piano</h2>
                <p>I've been playing piano since I was 7, and before I knew it, I ended up majoring in piano performance. I particularly love classical piano music, with Chopin being my favorite composer. Alongside solo repertoire, I have also played in trios and duets in the past. My hope is that one day, I can perform a piano concerto with an orchestra. You can find a link to my musical accomplishments here (add link). </p>
